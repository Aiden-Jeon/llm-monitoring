Picture a guitar playing different notes – when a string vibrates in different ways, it makes different sounds. In the same way, when these tiny strings vibrate differently, they become different things, like particles that make up everything you see around you. So, when the strings wiggle and dance around in space, they interact with each other – sometimes they might hug and combine, and other times they might bounce off each other, just like friends playing together. When we look closely at these strings, they act like the little particles we learn about in science.
